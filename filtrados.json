You need to add temporary code to the entry point if you want to confirm that the webpack bundle is in the production JS.",

It is intended\nto reduce merge conflicts when we start moving over to a\nworld where topics are stored in a Topic table.\n\nAll tests that use this context manager do meaningful\nwrites/edits to the zerver_message table that touch\nMessage.subject.",
            "This is a very raw set of commits, but it starts us on the road to having a zerver_topics table.\n\nOne thing that's immediately actionable is that I need somebody with some SqlAlchemy chops to help me figure out how to do narrowing queries on topic when we join to another table.  It's not rocket science, just beyond my own SA knowledge.  See fd22f2a.\n\nThis series of commits creates a Topic table, and it tries to make the back end behave mostly the same way.\n\nI think we're pretty close to being able to have developers optimistically build features off of this branch, such as the following:\n- Make muting topics have a less hackish DB representation than a comma-delimited list of strings.\n- Send fewer strings over the wire to the front end.\n- Take advantage of topic ids for HTML elements like topic bars in the message list.\n- Add advanced features directly related to topics, like making them read-only, etc.\n\nThe one major place in the code that I've punted on so far is figuring out the semantics of topic name changes.  I've gained some insight on what to do there once we start discussion; I'm just too tired to elaborate now.\n\nThe biggest thing to figure out is probably how we change our backend caching strategy for messages in light of having a separate Topic table.  Some of my commits start to touch the cache, so we at least now have a concrete example to kibitz on.\n\nDealing with migration headaches is certainly out of scope for the current commit, but I do do a basic backfill for the dev environment.  To try to make devs able to track down bugs, I have a scheme where I corrupt message.subject on writes, so hopefully many failures will be more or less obvious.\n\nAlso, as vaguely alluded to above, I don't actually remove message.subject in this commit, and there are still some shims in the code that rely on it still existing.  I'm warming up to the idea that we should do a roll-out with two major changes--one to add the new table, and then another down the road to deprecate the old field.   But I'm only a couple hours into this experiment, so my views may change.",

            "This implements a substantial portion of the refactoring that will be required to implement #372 (running multiple Tornado processes).  The overall strategy of this is as follows:\n- Split the Tornado event system into two processes: a connection server (that handles auth and holds open longpolled user connections) and a queue server (that manages the queues for a particular set of users).  The idea is that each of those processes is easily shardable but the combination of them squashed together is less so.  \n- Remove database/memcached queries from the Tornado queue server component where possible, with the goal of having the queue server not accessing them at all, and the connection servers only access them in the auth decorators (in the future, we can change how auth works as well, but the issue is not pressing).  I believe this is basically achieved, modulo some transition code related to the Client object.  \n\nThere's some additional commits on top of this that implement splitting Tornado into two processes somewhat hackishly that you can check out to help understand where this is going:\nhttps://github.com/timabbott/zulip/commits/refactor-tornado-test\nWhile those work, I don't feel enough confidence in them to submit them for merge right now, but I think these prerequisite changes are ready for review.",

The `safe` filter is\n  explicitly applied as well.\n- Use `compressed_css()` instead of `{% compressed_css %}`. The `safe` filter\n  is explicitly applied as well.\n- `forloop.first` -> `loop.first`.\n- Use `{{ csrf_input }}` instead of `{% csrf_tokesn %}`.\n- Use `{# ... #}` instead of `{% comment %}`.\n- Create `css.jinja` template for Django Pipeline.\n- Use `url()` instead of `{% url %}`.\n- Use `_()` instead of `{% trans %}` because in Jinja `trans` is a block tag.\n- Use `{% trans %}` instead of `{% blocktrans %}`.\n- Add check to `user_profile` for `undefined` in templates/zerver/base.html.\n\nChanges in tools:\n- Check for `trans` block in `check-templates` instead of `blocktrans`\n\nChanges in backend:\n- Create custom `render_to_response` function which takes `request` objects\n  instead of `RequestContext` object. There are two reasons:\n  1. `RequestContext` is not compatible with Jinja2\n  2. `RequestContext` in `render_to_response` is deprecated\n- Add Jinja2 related support files in zproject/jinja2 directory. It\n  includes a custom backend and a template renderer, compressors for js\n  and css and Jinja2 environment handler.\n- Enable `slugify` and `pluralize` filters in Jinja2 environment.\n- Add Django 1.8 compatible `TEMPLATES` setting and remove `TEMPLATE_*`\n  settings.",
